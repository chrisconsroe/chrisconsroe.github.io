			<p>NYC-based tech person, subscriber to Bon Appetit's youtube channel, and non-ironic wearer of athleisure.</p>

			<p>I joined <a href="http://www.chartbeat.com" target="_blank">Chartbeat&rsquo;s</a> Solutions Engineering team in 2014 with no technical skills, but an affinity for self-directed learning, independent working, and solving puzzles &mdash; and ended up <a href="http://chrisconsroe.com/projects/ux/chartbeat-support-site.html" target="_blank">designing and building their support site</a>.</p>

			<p>I love talking about TV and have a strong opinion about everything so come talk to me.</p>
