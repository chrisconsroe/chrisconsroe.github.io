			<p>I&rsquo;m a self-taught web developer who loves beautifully organized things and thinking about how humans interact with browsers. Also I&rsquo;m an excellent apartment gardener, and enjoy transitioning lougewear into dayware.</p>

			<p>I joined <a href="http://www.chartbeat.com" target="_blank">Chartbeat&rsquo;s</a> Solutions Engineering team in 2014 with no technical skills, but an affinity for self-directed learning, independent working, and solving puzzles. Thanks to the internet and some wonderful coding mentors, I fell into web design and front-end development and have been pushing forward ever since.</p>
