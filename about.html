	<h1>Hi.</h1>

	<p>I'm Chris, an NYC-based tech nerd by way of Washington, D.C. I like code, cartoons, grayscale design, and functional loungewear. I dislike crowded movie theaters.</p>

	<p>Also I'm an excellent apartment gardener.</p>

	<p>I currently spend my days pretengineering as a member of the Marketing team at <a href="http://www.chartbeat.com" target="_blank">Chartbeat</a>. I specialize in HTML & CSS, sales enablement, and user experience projects. Iâ€™m just trying to learn as much as I can about graphic design, front-end development, and how the internet works.</p>

	<p>If you're curious, <a href="../projects/index.html">browse my projects</a>, or <a href="mailto:hello@chrisconsroe.com">get in touch</a>.</p>
