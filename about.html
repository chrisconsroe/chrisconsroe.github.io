			<p>Based nin NYC, I work in tech doing a whole range of things. I&rsquo;m an excellent apartment gardener, kitchen witch extraordinaire, and routinely wear athleisure to the office.</p>

			<p>I joined <a href="http://www.chartbeat.com" target="_blank">Chartbeat&rsquo;s</a> Solutions Engineering team in 2014 with no technical skills, but an affinity for self-directed learning, independent working, and solving puzzles. Thanks to the internet and some wonderful coding mentors, I fell into writing, designing, and coding for the web and have been pushing forward ever since.</p>
