	<h1>Salt &amp; Churn Brand Design</h1>

	<h2><strong>tldr;</strong> Brand and identity design project for SVA’s Graphic Design class.</h2>
	<h2><strong>Tools Used:</strong> Adobe Illustrator, Adobe InDesign, Sketch.</h2>

	<p>In the fall of 2015 I took a Graphic Design class at the School of Visual Arts in New York City and our final project was brand design for a completely random company; we each picked a kind of company (i.e. bookstore, coffee shop, tutoring service etc.) and a taget audience</p> 

	<p>I got "an ice cream shop for cowboys".</p>

	<p>We started with three possible mood boards, selected one, then refined it into a very clear brand direction, and ultimately produced a logo/wordmark and three pieces of branded content.</p>

	<p class="image-caption">The real challenge was keeping it from being aggressively "portland-y" or "hipster-y".</p>

	<p>This class was my first real push into design and for an introductory class, our teacher Jenny Kutnow (creative director at Etsy) gave us a lot of work and a lot of great feedback. I think what I admired most about her was how she taught by example of how to give constructive feedback on a designers work.</p>

	<p>And how to not take feedback personally.</p>

	<p>The class started with about 25 students but by the end of the semester we were a core group of about 12—at that point everyone was committing to their work and producing some really great designs.</p>

	<p class="image-caption">Get it? 'Salt & Churn' is how you make ice cream!

	<p>After a lot of iterations I decided on the name Salt & Churn using Lucida Grande for the main text and Avenir for the body copy. I kept trying to introduce a few key brand colors, but nothing really stuck. I used them for the packaging to denote flavor, but I didn’t feel like they really served a purpose in the main wordmark.</p>

	<p>From the research I did on modern day cowboys I decided to steer clear of the overly romanticized 'life on the prairie' stuff, or else my store would look too much like a hokey dive bar. Instead I wanted to focus textures like leather and wood and simple, paired-down flavors.</p>

	<p class="image-caption">The inspiration for the ‘ice cream and jam’ pairing came from my uncle, who grew up on a farm and whose mother would always serve homemade ice cream with a spoonful of her strawberry preserves.</p>

	<p>The menu and the sign came first—just setting the name onto different natural textures. I like to think that the name is literally branded onto the wooden sign.</p>

	<p>The packing was the hardest and something I’m still not incredibly happy with. It was hard to find a free version of a blank ice cream package and I wasn’t that successful with making it look real. Maybe I’ll go back to it one day.</p>
