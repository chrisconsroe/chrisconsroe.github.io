		<h2><strong>tldr;</strong> Made a bunch of product illustrations for Chartbeat’s support site and marketing materials.</h2>
		<h2><strong>tools::</strong> Sketch, Adobe Illustrator.</h2>

	<p>I like drawing. I did it a lot as a kid, and now as a 20-something kid I'm doing it with computers. It started because I needed graphics and illustrations for the Chartbeat projects I was working on and didn't really have the weight to get any of the actual designers' time. Also I don't really know much about image copyrights and am deathly afraid of breaking the law.</p>

	<p>So I decided to just start making them myself—the three graphics for the Support Site homepage were the first ones that I made using Sketch.</p>

	<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/support-site2.jpg"> <!-- image of main screen -->

	<p>As soon as I was able to make those, I realized how many more illustrations we needed for the other parts of the site, and got to work on a slew of others to use as timeless images of Chartbeat's products.</p>

	<p class="image-caption">One of these things is not like the other...</p>

	<p>These started out just as the cute little illustrations I did for our Support Site project, but they quickly took on a life of their own and even found their way into some of Chartbeat’s actual Marketing collateral.</p>

	<p>Check them out on the first two pages of the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pdf/chartbeat-welcome-packet-2016.pdf" target="_blank">Chartbeat Publishing Welcome Package</a>!</p>
