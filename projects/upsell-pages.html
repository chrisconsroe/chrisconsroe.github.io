		<h1>In-product Upsell Pages</h1>

		<h2><strong>tldr;</strong> Content and UX flow for product upsells for Chartbeat’s 2017 re-brand.</h2>
		<h2><strong>buzzwords:</strong> Information architecture, UX, content strategy.</h2>
	</div>

	<p>During Chartbeat’s 2017 company and product re-brand, I had the opportunity to work intimately with our Directors of Product Marketing and Design to rewrite product copy pretty much across the board—high-level projects (tool and feature naming, architecture, narrative) and granular details (in-product calls-to-action, marketing pages, and changelog release notes).</p>

    <p>To kick things off I did a design exploration of similar SaaS tools to get a sense of different ways that product UIs themselves help users understand how products are organized into pricing tiers. More importantly how do they show something that’s not in a user’s tier and transition users from product experience to upsell flow.</p>

    <p>Next our Director of Product Marketing and I did a mapping exercise, trying to images all cases where someone would find themselves investigating a part of Chartbeat’s product they don’t have access to. But of course we then had to widen how we defined “access”. With Chartbeat’s expansive product toolset, it’s entirely possible for an account to have a tool included in their pricing tier, but an individual user to not have access to it. Each case needs to be planned for.</p>

    <p>Eventually we delivered microcopy for the in-product experience, and worked with design to make sure it was the right amount of text, it was tailored for the desired end case, and made sense with the CTA.</p>

    <p>This one’s certainly ongoing, especially as Chartbeat’s sales strategy continues to evolve and have more and more segmented needs, the link between product experience and sales experience needs to be even more tightly . But one thing fun about this is how easy it is to measure effectiveness, since it’s easy to tell how many upsell opportunities were generated by the in-product pages.</p>
