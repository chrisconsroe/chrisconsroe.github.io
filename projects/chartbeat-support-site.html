		<h1>Chartbeat Support Site</h1>

		<h2><strong>tldr;</strong> Designed, coded, and launched brand new support site for Chartbeat customers.</h2>
		<h2><strong>Tools Used:</strong> HTML/CSS, Bootstrap.js, Jekyll, Sketch.</h2>
	</div>
		
	<p>The first thing I ever did—the project that really got me excited about coding and design—was a complete overhaul of the client-facing support site for Chartbeat. Before the re-design, the support site was just an list of FAQs built off of the support inbox. Not only was it a little bit outdated looking, but during my time on the Chartcorps support team, I created a ton of implementation documents and educational videos that needed to live somewhere, and ended up on a series of disconnected, static web pages, with no relationship or hierarchy.</p>

	<p>It was hard for anyone, customer or coworker, to find specific resources on their own.</p>

	<p>That was the problem we decided to solve. My then-coworker, now NYC designer/developer <a href="http://samchieng.com" target="_blank">Sam Chieng</a>, teamed up to tackle this project beginning to end: design, code, execute, and launch a fully integrated support experience.</p>

	<p>Another Chartcorps teammate, <a href="https://github.com/peejsmith" target="_blank">PJ Smith</a>, did all the JavaScript for the integration with Chartbeat’s status page. That might actually be my favorite part.</p>

	<p>You can see it live at <a href="http://support.chartbeat.com" target="_blank">support.chartbeat.com</a>!</p>

	<p>We also got a chance to write about the experience and process for Chartbeat’s blog—check out <a href="http://blog.chartbeat.com/2015/07/01/designing-support-part-1-understand-define-ideate/" target="_blank">part 1 (by me)</a> and <a href="http://blog.chartbeat.com/2015/07/09/designing-support-part-2-prototype-build-iterate/" target="_blank">part 2 by Sam</a>.</p>

	<p class="image-caption">Would you believe each one of these took like six hours?</p>

	<p>While we worked collaboratively throughout most of the whole project, we did divide up some of the work based on our skillsets; Sam already had a background in coding and building websites whereas I had only started teaching myself HTML & CSS only a few months previously.</p>

	<p>So she build a ton of the foundation and site architecture (including researching static site generators and learning all about how Jekyll works), and I focused on illustrating the three images for the homepage cards. We didn’t want to have to think about copyrights and ownership so we figured we’d make our own custom graphics for the main landing page.</p>

	<p>Like all initial launches, the first version of the Support Site still had some holes in it, and when Hackweek came around at Chartbeat, I decided that my project should be making a 404 page for the Support Site!</p>

	<p>Which meant I needed to learn how to do that.</p>    

	<p>I started with the design—which of course went through many iterations—and using a combination of Sketch and Illustrator (and Photoshop to turn a bunch of layers into a gif) finally got the "robot-staring-at-a-flickering-light-bulb" live- check it out at <a href="http://support.chartbeat.com/foo" target="_blank">support.chartbeat.com/foo</a>.</p>

	<p>Not only was this my first serious application of web design and HTML/CSS, as we hosted it within Chartbeat’s repo on Github, it started to get me familiar with version control and using git, and is responsible for my first little green "proof of commit" squares.</p>
