		<h1>Charley Site</h1>

		<h2><strong>tldr;</strong> Personal webiste design and development for entrepreneur Charley Todd.</h2>
		<h2><strong>tools:</strong> Flexbox, HTML&CSS, JQuery</h2>
	</div>

	<p>Our first assigment in New York Code + Design Academy's Front-End 101 bootcamp was a one page website and my friend/entrepreneur/writer/social butterfly Charley Todd needed a webiste for his personal brand. So that was easy.</p>

	<p>Even better Charley had already created his own style guide complete with brand colors, fonts, language guidelines, and illustration and layout styles. Armed with that, working up an on-brand design was realatively straightforward.</p>

	<p class="image-caption">Design credit to <a href="http://focuslabllc.com/" target="_blank">Focus Lab</a> for the style guide.</p>

	<p>One of the things I've been working on is integrating something new into projects I take on and in this case I was excited to use <a href="http://flexboxgrid.com/" target="_blank">Flexbox</a>. Even when I started really getting the hang of CSS I still had a hard time with floating&mdash;and if I'm being honest I still don't 100% get it.</p>

	<p>When I brought it up to one of my developer friends, he simply said, "why are you even still using float? Just use Flexbox". After which I promptly googled Flexbox and rejoiced beacause <strong>it makes so much sense</strong>.</p>

	<p>CSS-Tricks has a really great <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/">overview of the syntax</a> that I still constantly reference, and there's a cute game called <a href="http://flexboxfroggy.com/">Flexbox Froggy</a> that I'd highly recommend.</p>

 	<p>I think I'll always like design but one of the best things about this bootcamp has been getting to really dive into JavaScript and the core technical aspects of front-end development. Of course developing for the web will always have a big crossover with design (which is great for people who also enjoy design) but I'm most excited that my instincts to follow coding have been right on. I remember from the design class that I took that I would get tired of trying to solve design problems after a while. Code problems just make me happy.</p>
