		<h1>Product launch content: Longform Case Study</h1>

		<h2><strong>tldr;</strong> Longform customer case study to pair with Chartbeat’s 2017 subscriber analytics product launch.</h2>
		<h2><strong>buzzwords:</strong> case study, research, writing, product launch.</h2>

	<p>When Chartbeat <a href="http://blog.chartbeat.com/2017/08/03/announcing-subscriber-engagement/">announced subscriber analytics</a> in August 2017, bringing it to market involved a lot of moving pieces (as all go-to-market plans do), the piece I was most proud to own was a piece of product launch content explicitly tied to the value of measuring subscribers—a longform case study with the German national daily, DIE WELT.</p>

    <p>This project was fun for me&mdash;not only was it a great opportunity to think more deeply about how to pair different kinds of collateral with product launches but it was genuinely a pleasure to write.</p>

    <p>Collaborating with Chartbeat’s Director of Product Marketing, I first received all the primary sources I had to work with: a video of DIE WELT presenting at a conference, a factsheet going over their company’s history and KPIs, and our own collection of user interviews we conducted.</p>

    <p>From there I pitched a couple of different thesis ideas to our Product Marketing Director, she and I agreed on the one we felt was the strongest narrative and aligned most with the positioning of the subscriber analytics capability in the product, and sketched out areas of support.</p>

    <p>And then it was left to me to write&mdash;always my favorite part. Fast-forward several rounds of edits, getting the copy approved by our partners at DIE WELT, and funneling it through our Marketing Designer, and we were ready to go-to-market.</p>
