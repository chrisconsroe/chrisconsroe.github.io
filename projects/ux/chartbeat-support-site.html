	<h3>Phase 1: Understand</h3>
	<p>When I first started at Chartbeat in 2014 on the Solutions team, our primary role was responding to customer and user help tickets. In those days, the support resources available to users (and the company) were a series of disconnected, static web pages with no relationship or hierarchy. It was extremely difficult for prospective clients to implement any part of Chartbeat code or users to learn more about product functionality, and impossible for anyone to have a cohesive support experience.</p>

	<p>That was the problem my then-coworker, <a href="http://samchieng.com" target="_blank">Sam Chieng</a>, and I teamed up to solve. From beginning to end design, build, and launch a support site.</p>

	<h3>Phase 2: Define</h3>
	<p>Before putting anything down on paper, we first needed to figure out exactly who we were designing for. We talked through a lot of examples of why someone would come to a Chartbeat support center and what outcomes they would be expecting. For example:<p>
	<ul>
		<li>When looking to implement the Chartbeat code, I want to find full technical documentation, so I can get my site up and running.</li>
		<li>When using Chartbeat for the first time, I want to know what specific metrics mean, so I can put them in practice and incorporate the tool into my daily workflow.</li>
		<li>When I have a specific question already formed in my mind, I want to quickly and easily find the answer, so I can go back to using the tool.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Phase 3: Design & Prototype</h3>
	<p>In the Ideate phase, we were able to lay out the informational groundwork, but we still needed to figure out details around navigational flow and visual consistency.</p>

	<p>Sam and I used Sketch and InVision to generate quick wireframes to get a better sense of how users could interact with the site. We made a few versions to compare and get feedback from the rest of the team and our designers — an incredibly useful step for planning how to scale our site for future resources.</p>

	<h3>Phase 5: Build</h3>
	<p>At the time, I had been learning a lot of code on my own with resources like <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Harvard’s online CS50 course</a>, <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">Codecademy</a>, and <a href="https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/" target="_blank">Learn Python the Hard Way</a>, but putting everything all together in a cohesive, scalable system was a brand new experience for us.</p>

	<p>Ultimately, we choose a static site generator called <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>.</p>

	<p>While building the site, we found a lot of parallels with the design process. We spent a lot of time understanding, ideating, and prototyping different file structures to reflect the design of the site from the user’s view. We ended up using a cascade of templates and section-specific files to have a modular site that new members of Chartcorps could easily add to or edit.</p>

	<h3>Phase 6: Iterate & Learn</h3>
	<p>Sam and I initially launched the site in 2014 and since then, I've been maintaining it steadily through 2018 as it adapts to new products, features, and even the 2017 rebrand.</p>

	<p>The biggest change then (besides the colors and fonts) was refining the sub-menu for the Education section to mirror the new product navigation itself.</p>
