	<p>Various mini-projects writing for the Chartbeat product, many of which coincided with the 2017 rebrand which began with a comprehensive copy audit . Also includes product and feature launches.</p>

	<h3 id="cross-sell">Microcopy: Cross-sell pages</h3>

	<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Users have no way of knowing which parts of the nav system they have access to, nor do they have clear paths to learn more about premium tools without leaving the product experience.</p>

	<p>As a first step, I did a design exploration of similar SaaS tools to get a sense of different ways that product UIs themselves help users understand how products are organized into pricing tiers. More importantly how do they show something that’s not in a users' tier and transition users from product experience to upsell flow.</p>

	<p>Working with Nalini Edwin, Chartbeat's Director of Product Marketing and Alex Zack, Senior Product Designer (and designer of the new navigation system), we mapped all cases where someone would find themselves investigating a part of Chartbeat’s product they don’t have access to. With Chartbeat’s expansive product toolset, it’s entirely possible for an account to have a tool included in their pricing tier, but an individual user to not have access to it. Each case needs to be planned for.</p>

	<p>Eventually we delivered microcopy for the in-product experience, and worked with design to make sure it was the right amount of text, it was tailored for the desired end case, and made sense with the CTA.</p>

	<h3 id="reports-onboard">Product Onboarding: Reports</h3>

	<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Reports replaced an existing legacy daily report and upon launch, users needed to know that Chartbeat had converted their existing report subscriptions into the new design.</p>

	<h3 id="top-pages">Microcopy: Top Pages</h3>

	<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Top Pages view of a landing page does not have a clear path to Optimization tools.</p>

	<p>Within the realm of Chartbeat's Real-Time Dashboard, users evaluate landing pages differently than articles. Becuase landing pages and the Heads Up Display optimization tool are so linked, users need a clear path between them.</p>
